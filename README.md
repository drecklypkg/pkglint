pkglint detects common mistakes and stylistic issues in
[pkgsrc](https://www.pkgsrc.org/) package definitions.
It produces warnings, errors and notes and, upon request, explains them.

Before importing a new package or making changes to an existing package,
pkglint should be run in the package's directory to check for common
errors.
