 8. apb@ suggested that pkglint should warn if a package with an OWNER
 has been modified and the OWNER isn't the current user. And perhaps
 also for MAINTAINER (if the MAINTAINER is not pkgsrc-users) but at a
 lower level. This seems like a good idea and hasn't been done. Note
 that while using cvs diff to check for modifications is unacceptably
 expenssive, reading the CVS control files (which pkglint already does
 to check for un-CVS'd patches, for example) should let it check by
 timestamp.


 15. net/uucp/Makefile has a make loop that's used to substitute
 variable names, and this confuses it.
