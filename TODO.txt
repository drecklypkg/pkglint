Align commented variable assignments

In some continuation lines, the continuation backslashes are right-aligned in column 72.
If they are before, they must also be like that afterwards.

When running "pkglint --autofix --only aligned", the PLISTs are nevertheless re-sorted
and autofixed. This is unexpected.
