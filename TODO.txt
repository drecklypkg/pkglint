 7. It still demands a LICENSE for meta-packages, which is silly.


 8. apb@ suggested that pkglint should warn if a package with an OWNER
 has been modified and the OWNER isn't the current user. And perhaps
 also for MAINTAINER (if the MAINTAINER is not pkgsrc-users) but at a
 lower level. This seems like a good idea and hasn't been done. Note
 that while using cvs diff to check for modifications is unacceptably
 expenssive, reading the CVS control files (which pkglint already does
 to check for un-CVS'd patches, for example) should let it check by
 timestamp.


 9. If LICENSE is no-commercial-use it should print something about
 what to do instead (that is, extract the package's own specific
 license) as well as saying that the setting is deprecated.


 10. It should stop demanding desktop.db unless the .desktop file
 involved declares a MimeType. This is going to be a pain, but it's
 fairly important. It's possible that this check should be migrated out
 of pkglint and into the pkgsrc infrastructure as a check after
 stage-install, because then the desktop files are at least available
 for analysis.


 12. (new) It doesn't know about the new per-OS settings, e.g:
    CONFIGURE_ENV.SunOS is defined by not used. (archivers/libarchive)
    CONFIGURE_ARGS.Darwin is defined but not used. (graphics/clutteR)
    MAKE_ENV.Interix is defined but not used. (devel/bmake)


 15. net/uucp/Makefile has a make loop that's used to substitute
 variable names, and this confuses it.

CONFIGURE_ENV+=         SYS_TAR_COMMAND_PATH=${TOOLS_TAR:Q}
